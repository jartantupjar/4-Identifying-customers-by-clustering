    "1. K-Means has a better running time and does better for high dimentional data and lastly, its results are easier to interpret.\n",

    "### Implementation: Creating Clusters\n",
    "Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data — if any. However, we can quantify the \"goodness\" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.\n",
    " - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.\n",
    " - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.\n",
    " - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.\n",
    " - Import `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.\n",
    "   - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result."

    "**Answer:** Sample point 0 is predicted as part of cluster 1 which represents a retail/grocery store. Sample point 1 and 2 are predicted in cluster 0 which represents a hotel. The points belonging to those clusters seems about right, sample point 0 does have a rather balanced purchase except for its Fresh category. Sample point 1 and 2 also seems right as they both have large amount of purchased detergents and paper."

    "In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships."

    "### Question 10\n",
    "Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. *How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*  \n",
    "**Hint:** Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?"

    "\n",
    "We can make use of A/B testing as basis for our change, instead of generalizing all the customers we could have both segments(retail and hotel) have its own control and treatment group. Each segment would need to have about 20 customers in total that will be split(10 in control and 10 in treatment). The 2 control groups would keep using the 5 days a week delivery service while the 2 treatment groups would be using the 3 days a week delivery service. After one cycle(appears to be 1 week), we can see if customer purchases either maintained, decreased or increased in the treatment groups in comparison to its respective control group. If customer purchases increased or at least maintained then we can say that this particular segment had a positive reaction but if it decreased then its a negative reaction."

    "### Question 11\n",
    "Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.  \n",
    "*How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the* ***customer segment*** *data?*  \n",
    "**Hint:** A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable?"

    "**Answer:** A supervised learner can be used to determine the 10 new customers' segments. Our target variable will be the  customer segment and the predictor variables will be our 6 categories. After building and training the model, we can use the 10 new customers anticipated annual spending to predict their respective segment."

    "\n",
    "At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling."

    "*How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?*"

    "**Answer:** The clustering algorithm does a pretty good job when comparing it to this distribution. Neither of the 2 customer segments have classifications that appear to be purely Retailers or Hotels. We can see from the plot above that there are some data points that can belong to the other segment. The hotel segment however has a more clear cluster as it has a lot less green points(retailer data points)in its side(right side) in comparison to the retailer segment as it has a lot of red points(hotel data points) that are in its side(left side). I do consider these classifications as consistent with my previous definition of the cluster segments, the 3 sample points from the beginning are just about where I expected them to be."
